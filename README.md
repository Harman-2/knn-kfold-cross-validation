# KNN with K-Fold Cross Validation

Implementation of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm from scratch, evaluated using **K-Fold Cross Validation**, and compared against Scikit-Learn’s KNN implementation on multiple datasets.

## Features
- KNN implemented from scratch in Python  
- 10-Fold Cross Validation from scratch  
- Comparison with Scikit-Learn’s `KNeighborsClassifier`  
- Evaluation on datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository  

## Datasets Used
- Hayes-Roth Dataset  
- Car Evaluation Dataset  
- Breast Cancer Dataset  

## Requirements
- Python 3.13.5 (managed with pyenv)
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook:  
```bash
jupyter notebook knn_project.ipynb
